# Prerequisites #

XSpec requires an XSLT 2.0 processor to [run XSpec](RunningXSpec.md). The batch and shell scripts assume that you'll be using Saxon, and **you must set the path to Saxon in the script**.

If you want to validate your XSpec description documents, you'll need a [RELAX NG validator](http://relaxng.org/#validators).
