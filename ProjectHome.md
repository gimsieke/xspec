XSpec is a [Behavior Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) (BDD) framework for [XSLT](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20) and [XQuery](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery). It is based on the Spec framework of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), which is a BDD framework for Ruby.

XSpec consists of a syntax for describing the behaviour of your XSLT or XQuery code, and some code that enables you to test your code against those descriptions.

An external project, [jxsl](http://code.google.com/p/jxsl/), provides a Maven archetype for XSpec (Ant is expected soon).  The goal is to provide everything needed to integrate with Continuous Integration tools for Java (like Hudson, Cruise Control, etc.)  See Benoit's [presentation at Balisage 2011](http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Mercier01/BalisageVol7-Mercier01.html) in Montreal for more info.
